DESCRIPTION::
This UGen creates an AOO sink on the Server. It receives audio stream from one or more AOO sources (e.g. link::Classes/AooSend::) and sends the signal to its outputs. If the sink receives several streams on the same channel(s), the signals on each channel are automatically summed.


CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: ar

ARGUMENT:: port
the (fixed) UDP port number.

note::The port number can be shared among several instances of code::AooSend:: and/or code::AooReceive:: emphasis::within a single application::.::

ARGUMENT:: id
a fixed, positive Integer which uniquely identifies the AOO sink on the given port.

note::There must be no two code::AooReceive:: objects with the same ID on the same port. You can, however, have two code::AooReceive:: objects with the same ID but on different ports!::

ARGUMENT:: numChannels
the (fixed) number of output channels.

ARGUMENT:: latency
the initial jitter buffer latency size in seconds.

Increase this value for unstable or jittery networks. If the latency is large enough, lost packets can even be resent in time (see link::Classes/AooReceiveCtl#-resend::) and the stream becomes more and more reliable.

For low latency applications, you should set the latency as low as possible, possibly risking occasional drop outs or relying on packet-loss-concealment (see link::Classes/AooFormatOpus::).

note::The code::latency:: argument is read once during construction and can not be modulated! If you want to set the latency dynamically, you can use the link::Classes/AooReceiveCtl#-latency:: method.::

ARGUMENT:: tag
(optional) a Symbol which uniquely identifies this UGen within a SynthDef.

This is only required if you have more than one code::AooReceive:: instance in a given SynthDef! See the corresponding code::tag:: argument in link::Classes/AooReceiveCtl#*new:: or link::Classes/AooReceiveCtl#*collect::.
